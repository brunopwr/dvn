# CHANGES TO dvn 0.3 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##
* Support for the Data Deposit API has been added in the form of a `dvDepositQuery` workhorse function and some wrappers that search a user's dataverse(s): `dvServiceDoc`, `dvUserStudies`, `dvStudyAtom`, and `dvStudyStatement`. Functions to create, release, and delete studies are also supported: `dvCreateStudy`, `dvReleaseStudy`, and `dvDeleteStudy`.
  * From v0.2.4, dataverse username and password can be set globally with `options('dvn.user')` and `options('dvn.pwd')`.
  * From v0.2.35, `dvEditStudy` is also functional, along with both `dvAddFile` and `dvDeleteFile`.
* The default dataverse (Harvard IQSS Dataverse) is now specified as a global option, which can be user-redefined with `options('dvn')`.

## BUG FIXES ##
* Fixed a bug in `dvDownload` that failed to propagate the correct dataverse to `dvDownloadInfo` (h/t Egon Willighagen)


# CHANGES TO dvn 0.2 #

## BUG FIXES ##

* Removed SSL verification from `dvQuery` to prevent errors due to a new site certificate for DVN (released 2013-06-27). May be restored in a future version once RCurl stops producing an error.
