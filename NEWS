# CHANGES TO dvn 0.3 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES ##
* Support for the Data Deposit API has been added in the form of a `dvDepositQuery` workhorse function and some wrappers (`dvServiceDoc`, `dvUserStudies`, `dvStudyAtom`, and `dvStudyStatement`).
* The default dataverse (Harvard IQSS Dataverse) is now specified as a global `option`, which can be user-redefined.

## BUG FIXES ##
* Fixed a bug in `dvDownload` that failed to propogate the correct dataverse to `dvDownloadInfo` (h/t Egon Willighagen)


# CHANGES TO dvn 0.2 #

## BUG FIXES ##

* Removed SSL verification from `dvQuery` to prevent errors due to a new site certificate for DVN (released 2013-06-27). May be restored in a future version once RCurl stops producing an error.
